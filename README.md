# 🚢 Titanic Survival EDA — Data Exploration Journey

> *“What can the Titanic teach us about survival? Let’s dive deep — without hitting the iceberg.”*

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the legendary Titanic dataset.  
We explore **passenger demographics, ticket classes, survival rates, and hidden patterns** — all brought to life through **statistical summaries** and **vivid visualizations**.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** — Data wrangling
- **Matplotlib** — Basic plotting
- **Seaborn** — Beautiful statistical visuals
- **Jupyter Notebook** — Interactive analysis

---

## 📊 Key Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Inspection** — Shape, missing values, data types.
2. **Statistical Overview** — `.describe()` for numerical insights.
3. **Categorical Analysis** — `.value_counts()` for distributions.
4. **Visual Storytelling**:
   - 📈 **Histograms** for age & fare distributions.
   - 📦 **Boxplots** for age across passenger classes.
   - 🔥 **Heatmaps** for correlation between variables.
   - 👫 Survival patterns by gender & class.

---

## 🔍 Interesting Observations
- **Women & children** had significantly higher survival rates.
- **1st-class passengers** were more likely to survive.
- Strong correlation between **fare** and **passenger class**.
- Many passengers had **unknown ages** — possible analysis bias.

---

## 📑 Deliverables
- **`titanic_eda.ipynb`** — Full Jupyter Notebook with analysis & visuals.
- **`report.pdf`** — Concise PDF report of findings.
